# IITR MDG Merge Conflict
This repository is for IIT Roorkee's MDG Merge Conflict.

This is a game where you are playing as a motorcycle & you have to destroy the automated motorcycle.
You can use WASD or up down left right to move.
You can use space bar to launch missiles to destroy the enemy motorcycle.
You can use return key if your bike falls sideways or backwards to orient your bike again.
Due to time limitations I have not added UI of Game Over Screen, just done Debug.Log("You Win") or Debug.Log("Game Over").

Also the missile on colliding with other missile gets destroyed.
